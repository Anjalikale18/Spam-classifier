# SMS Spam Detection Using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This repository contains the code  for an SMS Spam Detection system using Support Vector Machines (SVM).  The primary objective of this project is to accurately classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" using machine learning techniques.Spam  messages pose significant challenges, affecting both communication efficiency and security. This project aims to develop a reliable spam detection model using SVM, a robust method for binary classification tasks.
